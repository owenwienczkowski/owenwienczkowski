# Welcome! ðŸŽŠ

I am glad to see you have navigated to my page.

I am Owen Wienczkowski, a graduate student at Durham University pursuing my Master's of Data Science.

In 2024 I graduated from Penn State where I earned my B.S. in Software Engineering with a Minor in Computer Science.

My interests include large language models, natural language processing, and financial technologies. 

I am ambitous to learn and am actively seeking opportunities to do so.
