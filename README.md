# Welcome! ðŸŽŠ

I am glad to see you have navigated to my page.

I am Owen Wienczkowski, I am graduating from Penn State in May 2024 with a B.S. in Software Engineering and a Minor in Computer Science.

Starting Fall 2025 I will be a graduate student at Durham University where I will be earning my Master's of Data Science.

My interests include deep learning and mathematics, primarily statistics. 

I am ambitous to learn and am actively seeking opportunities to do so.
